## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive YouTube content automation system built with Node.js that transforms YouTube videos into optimized short-form content using AI. The system orchestrates a complete workflow from URL processing to final video delivery through Google Sheets, Google Drive, and Telegram integrations.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
npm start              # Start production system with cron scheduling
npm run dev            # Development mode with nodemon auto-restart
npm run lint           # ESLint code checking - MUST pass before commits
npm run typecheck      # TypeScript validation - MUST pass before commits
npm test               # Run Jest test suite - MUST pass before commits
```

### 🔧 Recent Workflow Fixes (Latest Update)

**Critical Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ **Master Sheet Population**: Optimized content (title, description, keywords) now only goes to Video Detail sheets, not master sheet
- ✅ **Status Progression**: Workflow correctly moves from "Script Separated" → "Completed" when image generation is disabled
- ✅ **Video Info Sheet**: Now properly populated with complete metadata, optimized content, and full script sections
- ✅ **Script Text Truncation**: Full sentence text preserved in script breakdowns (no more cut-off text)
- ✅ **Image Prompts**: Generated when script breakdown enabled, even if image generation is disabled
- ✅ **Analytics Tab**: Now populated with processing metrics and video analytics
- ✅ **Full Script Sections**: Added comprehensive sections for Video Editor and Voice Generator workflows
- ✅ **Voice Script Enhancement**: `voice_script.txt` now formats each sentence on a separate line for optimal voice generation

**Current Working Configuration:**
```bash
ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=false   # Disabled to save costs
ENABLE_SCRIPT_BREAKDOWN=true    # Enabled for detailed script analysis
AUTO_APPROVE_SCRIPTS=true       # Optional: enables automatic approval for testing
```

### Configuration Toggle Options

The system supports configurable workflow stages through environment variables:

**Image Generation Control (Default: Disabled)**
```bash
ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=false  # Enable/disable image generation completely
ENABLE_SCRIPT_BREAKDOWN=true   # Enable/disable script sentence breakdown  
```

**Cost-Optimized Workflow Options:**
- `ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=false`: Skips DALL-E image generation entirely, saves ~$0.40-0.80 per video
- `ENABLE_SCRIPT_BREAKDOWN=true`: Creates detailed sentence-level script breakdown with image prompts
- **Fixed Workflow**: Now correctly progresses through all statuses regardless of image generation setting

**Current Workflow Behavior:**
- **New** → **Processing** → **Script Separated** → **Completed** (when images disabled)
- **Video Detail Sheets**: Populated with optimized content, full scripts, and processing analytics
- **Script Breakdown**: Individual sentences with image prompts and editor keywords
- **Master Sheet**: Contains only basic tracking data (no optimized content)

## Architecture Overview

### Service-Oriented Architecture
The system follows a service-oriented pattern with a central WorkflowService orchestrating specialized services:

```
WorkflowService (Central Orchestrator)
├── YouTubeService       # Video metadata/transcript extraction  
├── GoogleSheetsService  # Database operations & approval workflows
├── GoogleDriveService   # Cloud storage for images & assets
├── AIService           # OpenAI/Anthropic content generation + DALL-E 3
├── TelegramService     # Notifications & manual approvals
├── StatusMonitorService # Manual status change monitoring & notifications
└── VideoService        # FFmpeg video processing & assembly
```

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Input Stage**: YouTube URLs tracked in Google Sheets with unique VideoID (VID-XX format)
2. **Extraction**: Video metadata, transcripts, thumbnails via YouTube API with 5-layer fallback
3. **AI Enhancement**: Script optimization, descriptions, titles using GPT-4o-mini
4. **Organization**: Hierarchical Google Sheets structure (Master Sheet → Video Info Sheet → Script Details Sheet)
5. **Approval**: Auto-approval or manual review workflow via Telegram notifications
6. **Generation**: AI image creation (DALL-E 3, 16:9 format), consistent styling, thumbnail generation
7. **Storage**: Assets uploaded to Google Drive with shareable links
8. **Completion**: Video automation flow complete - ready for manual voice generation and video assembly
9. **Voice Processing**: Manual voice generation using optimized scripts (👤 Voice Generation Status selection tracking)
10. **Final Assembly**: Manual video creation with voice and images (handled outside the system)

### Key Design Patterns

#### Cron-Based Automation
- Multiple scheduled jobs run at different intervals (5-15 minutes)
- Each job processes different workflow stages independently (video generation removed from automation)
- **Enhanced Resume Capability**: Automatically handles interrupted workflows in any processing state
- **Status Change Monitoring**: Detects manual status changes every 5 minutes and sends Telegram notifications
- Graceful shutdown handling with SIGINT/SIGTERM signals

#### Status Change Monitoring System
- **Real-time Manual Updates**: Monitors Google Sheets for manual status changes every 5 minutes
- **Smart Change Detection**: Distinguishes between automated system changes and human modifications
- **Targeted Notifications**: Sends contextual Telegram alerts for different status types:
  - 🎙️ **Voice Generation Status**: Not Started → In Progress → Completed → Need Changes
  - 🎬 **Video Editing Status**: Not Started → In Progress → First Draft → Completed → Published
  - 📝 **Script Approval**: Pending → Approved → Needs Changes
- **Status Caching**: JSON file-based cache system to compare current vs. previous values
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Ignores automated transitions (e.g., 'Not Ready' → 'Not Started')
- **Batch Notifications**: Summary messages when multiple videos are updated simultaneously
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with notification fallback

#### Error Handling Strategy
- Comprehensive logging with Winston (logs/ directory)
- Telegram notifications with VideoID format (VID-XX - Video Title)
- Per-video error tracking with retry mechanisms
- **Smart Resume**: Videos stuck in "Processing" or "Generating Images" are automatically resumed
- Status tracking in Google Sheets database
- **Automated Error Recovery**: Complete retry system with exponential backoff
  - **Retry Schedule**: 1h → 2h → 4h → 8h cooldown between attempts
  - **Max Retries**: 3 attempts before permanent skip
  - **Smart Reset**: Videos reset to appropriate processing stage based on error location
  - **Cron Automation**: Automatic retry processing every 2 hours
  - **Manual Override**: Force retry capability for immediate testing
  - **Error Tracking Fields**: 5 dedicated columns in Google Sheets for complete error monitoring:
    - 🤖 Error Message (detailed error description)
    - 🤖 Error Stage (processing stage where error occurred)
    - 🤖 Error Time (timestamp of error occurrence)
    - 🤖 Retry Count (number of retry attempts made)
    - 🤖 Last Retry Time (timestamp of most recent retry)
  - **Telegram Integration**: Retry notifications with attempt count and cooldown info

#### State Management
- Google Sheets serves as primary state store with unique VideoID (VID-XX format)
- **Main Automation Status**: 'New' → 'Processing' → 'Script Separated' → 'Approved' → 'Generating Images' → 'Completed'
- **Voice Generation Status**: Auto-populated workflow tracking for voice generation phase
  - 'Not Ready' → 'Not Started' (auto-triggered when Script Separated)
  - 'Not Started' → 'In Progress' → 'Completed' → 'Need Changes' (manual transitions)
- **Video Editing Status**: Auto-populated workflow tracking for video editing phase
  - 'Not Ready' → 'Not Started' (auto-triggered when Automation = 'Completed' AND Voice = 'Completed')
  - 'Not Started' → 'In Progress' → 'First Draft' → 'Completed' → 'Published' (manual transitions)
- **Legacy Voice Status**: Separate checkbox field for backward compatibility (still supported)
- **Intelligent Recovery**: System detects and resumes interrupted workflows at correct stage
- **Auto-Population Logic**: Status transitions happen automatically without user intervention
- Manual approval gates prevent automated progression (optional auto-approval available)

### Voice Script Enhancement (Latest Feature)

**Enhanced voice_script.txt Format:**
- Each sentence now appears on its own line with double spacing
- Clean, readable format optimized for voice generation workflows
- Professional header with Video ID, title, and generation timestamp

**File Format Example:**
```
=== VOICE SCRIPT ===
Video ID: VID-0001
Video Title: [Video Title]
Generated: [Timestamp]

=== SCRIPT SENTENCES ===
First sentence goes here.

Second sentence goes here.

Third sentence goes here.
```

**Benefits:**
- Voice generators work better with sentence-by-sentence input
- Easy to track progress during voice recording
- Clean format without editing notes or technical instructions
- Automatically uploaded to each video's Google Drive folder

### Workflow Status Auto-Population

The system automatically manages Voice Generation Status and Video Editing Status transitions to provide clear workflow progression indicators without requiring manual status updates.

#### Voice Generation Status Auto-Population
- **Trigger**: When main automation reaches "Script Separated" status
- **Transition**: "Not Ready" → "Not Started"
- **Logic**: Indicates that script is ready for voice generation workflow
- **Manual Control**: Users manually progress through: "Not Started" → "In Progress" → "Completed" → "Need Changes"

#### Video Editing Status Auto-Population  
- **Trigger**: When BOTH conditions are met:
  1. Main automation status = "Completed" (automation workflow finished)
  2. Voice Generation Status = "Completed" (voice generation finished)
- **Transition**: "Not Ready" → "Not Started"
- **Logic**: Ensures video editing only begins after both automation and voice generation are complete
- **Manual Control**: Users manually progress through: "Not Started" → "In Progress" → "First Draft" → "Completed" → "Published"

#### Implementation Details
- Status updates happen seamlessly during normal workflow processing
- No user intervention required for auto-population triggers
- System checks current status before updating to prevent overwriting manual changes
- Logging provides visibility into automatic status transitions
- Backward compatible with existing workflows and legacy Voice Status checkbox

<!-- ## Development Guidelines

### Service Dependencies
- Each service is autonomous but communicates through WorkflowService
- Services handle their own error states and logging
- AI services implement provider fallback (OpenAI → Anthropic)
- Google services implement proper authentication and rate limiting
- All file operations use absolute paths from project root

### Video Processing Notes
- FFmpeg operations are CPU/memory intensive
- Temporary files stored in `./temp/`, cleaned up automatically  
- Output videos target 2-3 minute duration with 1920x1080 resolution
- Text overlays use system fonts (Arial fallback)

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing via direct URL processing: `automation.processUrl(url)`
- Force processing methods available for each workflow stage
- Health check system monitors all external service connections
- System status accessible via `getSystemStatus()` method

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Dependency Issues
- **Canvas Package**: Removed from dependencies due to Python build requirements
  - If canvas functionality needed, install Python 3.7+ and rebuild
  - Alternative: Use sharp for image processing
- **FFmpeg Path**: Uses ffmpeg-static for cross-platform compatibility
  - If issues occur, install system FFmpeg: `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS)

#### API Integration Issues
- **API Rate Limits**: All services implement intelligent retry with exponential backoff
  - YouTube API: 10,000 requests/day free tier
  - OpenAI: Rate limits vary by tier, implement queuing
  - Google APIs: Usually sufficient for normal usage
- **Authentication Failures**: 
  - Check .env file formatting (especially GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY newlines)
  - Verify service account permissions for Google Drive and Google Sheets
  - Ensure Google service account has proper API access and sharing permissions

#### Performance Issues
- **Memory Usage**: Video processing can spike to 1-2GB per concurrent operation
  - Monitor with: `process.memoryUsage()`
  - Adjust CONCURRENT_WORKERS in .env (default: 4)
- **Processing Timeouts**: Long-running operations may timeout
  - Increase timeout values in service configurations
  - Implement progress tracking for long operations

#### Error Handling Patterns
```javascript
// Retry with exponential backoff
const retryWithBackoff = async (fn, maxRetries = 3) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2 ** i * 1000));
    }
  }
};

// Service health check
const checkServiceHealth = async (service) => {
  try {
    return await service.healthCheck();
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(\`Service \${service.constructor.name} unhealthy:\`, error);
    return false;
  }
};
```

## Script Regeneration Workflow ("Needs Changes" Handling)

When humans set Script Approved status to "Needs Changes" in the Master Sheet, the system automatically triggers a complete script regeneration workflow.

### Workflow Process

1. **Status Change Detection**: The status monitoring system (`StatusMonitorService`) running every 5 minutes detects when Script Approved field changes to "Needs Changes".

2. **Automatic Script Regeneration**: The system immediately:
   - **Creates Backup**: Existing script content is backed up to Google Drive with timestamp
   - **Resets Status**: Main automation status changes to "Processing"
   - **Resets Approval**: Script Approved field changes to "Pending" 
   - **Triggers Regeneration**: Video re-enters the script generation workflow
   - **Sends Notifications**: Multiple Telegram notifications about backup and regeneration process

3. **Telegram Notifications**: Three notifications are sent:
   ```
   🔄 Script Approval Updated
   🎬 VID-XX - Video Title
   📊 Status: [Previous Status] → Needs Changes
   👤 Manual update detected
   🔄 Script needs revision. Processing paused.
   ```
   
   Followed by backup confirmation:
   ```
   💾 Script Backup Created
   🎬 VID-XX - Video Title
   📄 Backup: voice_script_backup_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.txt
   🕒 Before regeneration
   💡 Previous script version preserved
   ```
   
   Then regeneration notification:
   ```
   🔄 Script Regeneration Started
   🎬 VID-XX - Video Title
   📊 Status: Processing
   👤 Triggered by "Needs Changes" request

   🔄 Action Taken:
   • Script backup created with timestamp
   • Main Status reset to "Processing"
   • Script Approved reset to "Pending"
   • New script generation will begin automatically

   ⏳ Next Steps:
   • System will regenerate script with AI
   • New script will be populated in sheets
   • Manual review will be requested when complete
   ```

4. **Regeneration Process**: 
   - `processNewVideos()` picks up the video in "Processing" status
   - Fresh AI analysis generates new script content
   - Video Info sheet and Script Details sheet are updated with new content
   - Video returns to "Ready for Review" with Script Approved = "Pending"
   - New approval request is sent via Telegram

### Implementation Details

- **StatusMonitorService**: Handles detection and triggering in `handleScriptNeedsChanges()` with backup creation
- **GoogleSheetsService**: Provides `updateVideoField()` for precise field updates and `createBackupVoiceScript()` for backups  
- **TelegramService**: Provides `sendScriptRegenerationStarted()` for detailed notifications
- **Monitoring Frequency**: 5-minute cron job ensures quick response to manual changes
- **Backup System**: Automatic backup creation with timestamped filenames before any regeneration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error notifications if regeneration fails, with backup process isolated to prevent workflow failure

### File Backup & Versioning

**Backup Creation Process:**
- **Trigger**: Automatically created before any script regeneration
- **Location**: Same Google Drive folder as the video (`/VideoID/`)
- **Filename**: `voice_script_backup_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-SSSZ.txt`
- **Content**: Full backup with metadata header including timestamp, video ID, and reason
- **Preservation**: Original script content preserved exactly as it was

**File Handling During Regeneration:**
- ✅ **Script Backup**: Created automatically with timestamp
- ✅ **Version Preservation**: Previous versions kept in Drive folder
- ✅ **Metadata Tracking**: Backup includes regeneration reason and timestamp
- ✅ **Non-Blocking**: Backup failure doesn't prevent regeneration workflow
- ✅ **Telegram Confirmation**: User notified when backup is successfully created

This workflow ensures that script revision requests are handled automatically without manual intervention, maintaining smooth operations while allowing for human quality control and preserving all previous script versions.

- `temp/` - Temporary processing files (auto-cleaned)
- `output/` - Final video assets before Google Drive upload

## Operational Notes

### Production Deployment
- System designed for continuous operation with cron scheduling
- Supports graceful shutdown for maintenance
- Logs provide detailed operation tracking
- Telegram integration enables remote monitoring

### Performance Characteristics
- Sequential processing: ~60 minutes per video
- Designed for 100-500 videos/month throughput
- Memory usage scales with concurrent video processing
- AI operations are the primary cost and time bottleneck

### Cost Management
- Primary costs: AI API usage ($30-80/month for 200-500 videos)
  - OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: $0.15/1M tokens (script generation)
  - OpenAI DALL-E 3: $0.04-0.08/image (visual assets)
  - Anthropic Claude: $3/1M tokens (fallback AI)
- YouTube API free tier usually sufficient (10,000 requests/day)
- Google APIs have generous free quotas:
  - Google Sheets API: 300 requests/minute per project
  - Google Drive API: 1,000 requests/100 seconds per user
- Infrastructure costs minimal ($25-50/month)
- Google Workspace not required (free Google account sufficient)

### Monitoring & Debugging

#### Logging Strategy
```javascript
// Log levels: error, warn, info, debug
logger.info('Processing started', { videoId, stage: 'extraction' });
logger.error('Processing failed', { videoId, error: error.message, stack: error.stack });

// Performance monitoring
const startTime = Date.now();
// ... operation
logger.info('Operation completed', { 
  videoId, 
  duration: Date.now() - startTime,
  memoryUsage: process.memoryUsage()
});
```

#### Health Check Implementation
```javascript
// Service health checks
const healthChecks = {
  youtube: () => youtubeService.testConnection(),
  googleSheets: () => googleSheetsService.testConnection(),
  googleDrive: () => googleDriveService.testConnection(),
  openai: () => aiService.testConnection(),
  telegram: () => telegramService.testConnection()
};

// System health endpoint
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(
    Object.entries(healthChecks).map(async ([name, check]) => ({
      service: name,
      healthy: await check()
    }))
  );
  res.json({ healthy: results.every(r => r.value.healthy), checks: results });
});
```

### Security Considerations
- Store API keys in .env file (never commit to git)
- Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Validate all external inputs (YouTube URLs, user data)
- Log security events and API usage patterns
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns or costs

## Advanced Development Patterns

### Service Extension Pattern
```javascript
// Extending existing services
class EnhancedAIService extends AIService {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.cache = new Map(); // Add caching
  }
  
  async generateAttractiveScript(transcript, metadata) {
    const cacheKey = `script_${metadata.videoId}`;
    if (this.cache.has(cacheKey)) {
      return this.cache.get(cacheKey);
    }
    
    const result = await super.generateAttractiveScript(transcript, metadata);
    this.cache.set(cacheKey, result);
    return result;
  }
}
```

### Workflow Customization
```javascript
// Custom workflow stages
const customWorkflow = {
  async processVideo(videoData) {
    const stages = [
      this.extractMetadata,
      this.generateContent,
      this.createVisuals,
      this.assembleVideo,
      this.uploadAssets
    ];
    
    for (const stage of stages) {
      try {
        await stage.call(this, videoData);
        await this.updateStatus(videoData.id, stage.name);
      } catch (error) {
        await this.handleStageError(videoData, stage.name, error);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### Testing Patterns
```javascript
// Service mocking for tests
const mockYouTubeService = {
  getVideoMetadata: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    title: 'Test Video',
    description: 'Test Description',
    channelTitle: 'Test Channel'
  }),
  getTranscript: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('Test transcript')
};

// Integration test example
describe('WorkflowService Integration', () => {
  test('processes video end-to-end', async () => {
    const mockVideo = { youtubeUrl: 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=test' };
    const result = await workflowService.processSingleVideo(mockVideo);
    
    expect(result.status).toBe('completed');
    expect(result.assets).toHaveProperty('videoPath');
    expect(result.assets).toHaveProperty('thumbnailPath');
  });
});
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Service Connection Issues
```bash
# Test individual services
node -e "
import('./src/services/youtubeService.js').then(async (service) => {
  const ys = new service.default();
  try {
    await ys.getVideoMetadata('dQw4w9WgXcQ');
    console.log('YouTube service: OK');
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('YouTube service: FAILED', e.message);
  }
});"

# Test Google Sheets service
node -e "
import('./src/services/googleSheetsService.js').then(async (service) => {
  const gs = new service.default();
  try {
    await gs.testConnection();
    console.log('Google Sheets service: OK');
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Google Sheets service: FAILED', e.message);
  }
});"

# Test Google Drive service
node -e "
import('./src/services/googleDriveService.js').then(async (service) => {
  const gd = new service.default();
  try {
    await gd.testConnection();
    console.log('Google Drive service: OK');
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Google Drive service: FAILED', e.message);
  }
});"
```

### Memory Leak Detection
```bash
# Monitor memory usage during processing
node --inspect src/index.js
# Then open chrome://inspect in browser
```

### Performance Profiling
```javascript
// Add to service methods
const { performance } = require('perf_hooks');

async function profiledMethod() {
  const start = performance.now();
  try {
    const result = await originalMethod();
    return result;
  } finally {
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    logger.info(`Method completed in ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);
  }
}
``` -->

### Common Error Patterns & Solutions
1. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: All services implement exponential backoff with 5-layer fallback
2. **VideoID Not Found**: Use proper Google Sheets row identification with VID-XX format
3. **Image Generation Budget**: DALL-E 3 with cost tracking and 5-image limit per video
4. **Workflow Interruption**: Smart resume capability handles "Processing", "Generating Images" states
5. **Google Drive Upload**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for file uploads
