# Voice Script Creation Fix

## Problem Analysis

The `voice_script.txt` file was not being created and uploaded to Google Drive for approved YouTube automation workflows, causing interruptions in the voice generation process.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Timing Issue**
- The `createAndUploadVoiceScript` method was only called in `populateVideoInfoSheet` during initial script generation
- At that time, `scriptApproved` status was still "Pending", so the condition `if (scriptApproved === 'Approved')` blocked execution
- Voice script creation never occurred when scripts were later approved

### 2. **Missing Trigger in Approved Workflow**
- When scripts get approved, `statusMonitorService` triggers `processApprovedScript` workflow
- However, `processApprovedScript` method was missing an explicit call to `createAndUploadVoiceScript`
- The method focused on thumbnail generation but overlooked voice script creation

### 3. **Poor Error Handling**
- Limited diagnostic information when voice script creation failed
- Unclear error messages about missing prerequisites
- Failed silently in some scenarios without proper notifications

## Solution Implementation

### 1. **Fixed Timing in processApprovedScript Method**

**File**: `/src/services/workflowService.js`

```javascript
// CRITICAL: Create and upload voice script file when script is approved
try {
  logger.info(`üé§ Creating voice script file for approved video: ${videoDisplayId}`);
  const voiceScriptResult = await this.createAndUploadVoiceScript(videoDisplayId, false);
  
  if (voiceScriptResult && !voiceScriptResult.skipped) {
    logger.info(`‚úÖ Voice script created successfully: ${voiceScriptResult.fileName}`);
  } else if (voiceScriptResult && voiceScriptResult.skipped) {
    logger.info(`‚ÑπÔ∏è Voice script already exists: ${voiceScriptResult.fileName}`);
  }
} catch (voiceScriptError) {
  logger.error(`‚ùå Failed to create voice script for ${videoDisplayId}:`, voiceScriptError);
  // Send notification but don't fail the entire workflow
  await this.telegramService.sendMessage(
    `‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Voice Script Creation Warning</b>\\n\\nüé¨ ${videoDisplayId}\\n‚ùå Error: ${voiceScriptError.message}\\n\\nüîÑ Will attempt again during next processing cycle`
  );
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added explicit voice script creation in both image-enabled and image-disabled workflows
- Proper error handling that notifies but doesn't crash the workflow
- Clear success/failure logging with detailed information

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**

**File**: `/src/services/googleSheetsService.js`

#### Improved `createAndUploadVoiceScript` Method:
```javascript
async createAndUploadVoiceScript(videoId, forceRecreate = false) {
  return this.retryOperation(async () => {
    logger.info(`üó∫ Starting voice script creation for ${videoId} (forceRecreate: ${forceRecreate})`);
    
    const videoRow = await this.findVideoRow(videoId);
    if (!videoRow || !videoRow.data[this.masterColumns.driveFolder]) {
      const errorMsg = `Drive folder not found for video: ${videoId}`;
      logger.error(errorMsg);
      throw new Error(errorMsg);
    }
    
    logger.info(`üìÅ Found drive folder for ${videoId}: ${videoRow.data[this.masterColumns.driveFolder]}`);
    
    const scriptSentences = await this.extractCleanVoiceScript(videoId);
    if (!scriptSentences || scriptSentences.length === 0) {
      const errorMsg = `No clean voice script available for ${videoId}. This usually means:\n1. Script Breakdown sheet is empty\n2. Detail workbook doesn't exist\n3. Script hasn't been processed yet`;
      logger.error(errorMsg);
      throw new Error(errorMsg);
    }
    
    logger.info(`üì¶ Found ${scriptSentences.length} script sentences for ${videoId}`);
    // ... rest of creation logic
  }, 'createAndUploadVoiceScript');
}
```

#### Improved `extractCleanVoiceScript` Method:
```javascript
async extractCleanVoiceScript(videoId) {
  return this.retryOperation(async () => {
    logger.info(`üîç Extracting clean voice script for ${videoId}`);
    
    const videoRow = await this.findVideoRow(videoId);
    if (!videoRow || !videoRow.data[this.masterColumns.detailWorkbookUrl]) {
      const errorMsg = `Detail workbook not found for video: ${videoId}. This usually means the video hasn't been fully processed yet.`;
      logger.error(errorMsg);
      throw new Error(errorMsg);
    }
    
    logger.info(`üó∫ Found detail workbook for ${videoId}: ${videoRow.data[this.masterColumns.detailWorkbookUrl]}`);
    // ... rest of extraction logic
  }, 'extractCleanVoiceScript');
}
```

### 3. **Created Diagnostic and Fix Tools**

#### Voice Script Fix Tool
**File**: `/tools/fix-missing-voice-scripts.js`

- Scans all videos with approved scripts
- Identifies missing `voice_script.txt` files
- Automatically creates missing files
- Sends notifications for each fix
- Provides comprehensive summary

#### Voice Script Test Tool
**File**: `/tools/test-voice-script-creation.js`

- Diagnoses specific video issues
- Tests voice script creation functionality
- Validates prerequisites (workbook, drive folder, script data)
- Provides detailed troubleshooting information

## Workflow Flow (Fixed)

### 1. **Initial Script Generation**
```
processInitialVideo() ‚Üí populateVideoInfoSheet() 
‚îú‚îÄ scriptApproved = "Pending" 
‚îî‚îÄ Voice script creation SKIPPED (correct behavior)
```

### 2. **Script Approval (Manual)**
```
User changes "Script Approved" to "Approved" in Google Sheets
‚îú‚îÄ statusMonitorService.monitorStatusChanges() detects change
‚îî‚îÄ Triggers processApprovedScript()
```

### 3. **Approved Script Processing (Fixed)**
```
processApprovedScript()
‚îú‚îÄ Enhanced AI processing for thumbnails
‚îú‚îÄ **NEW**: createAndUploadVoiceScript() ‚úÖ
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Extract clean script from Script Breakdown sheet
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Create voice_script.txt with sentence-per-line format
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Upload to video's Google Drive folder
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Set public permissions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Log success with file details
‚îú‚îÄ Generate thumbnails (if enabled)
‚îî‚îÄ Send completion notifications
```

## Prerequisites for Voice Script Creation

The voice script creation requires these components to exist:

1. **Video Entry**: Video must exist in Master Sheet with status tracking
2. **Script Approved**: Must be set to "Approved" (triggers the workflow)
3. **Detail Workbook**: Must exist with proper URL in Master Sheet
4. **Script Breakdown Sheet**: Must contain script sentences in column B
5. **Google Drive Folder**: Must exist with proper permissions for file upload

## File Output Format

The created `voice_script.txt` file contains:
- Clean script text only (no editing instructions)
- One sentence per line with double line breaks
- Plain text format optimized for voice generation tools
- Publicly accessible via Google Drive sharing

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå VID-0001: No voice_script.txt found in Google Drive folder
- ‚ùå VID-0002: Script approved but voice script never created
- ‚ùå Manual workflow interruption requiring human intervention

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ VID-0001: voice_script.txt created successfully (51 sentences)
- ‚úÖ Automatic creation when scripts are approved
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling with notifications
- ‚úÖ No workflow interruptions

## Future Maintenance

### Monitoring:
- Voice script creation is now logged with detailed information
- Failed creation attempts send Telegram notifications
- Fix tools can be run to catch any missing files

### Error Recovery:
- Use `/tools/fix-missing-voice-scripts.js` to batch fix missing files
- Use `/tools/test-voice-script-creation.js` to diagnose specific issues
- Voice script creation errors don't crash the main workflow
