# CTA Policy Implementation: External vs YouTube Platform

## Overview

Implemented refined CTA policy for YouTube script generation that distinguishes between:
- **External CTAs** (BLOCKED): Direct viewers away from YouTube to websites, downloads, external platforms
- **YouTube Platform CTAs** (ALLOWED): Keep viewers on YouTube and build channel engagement

This ensures pure educational content delivery while supporting natural channel growth through platform-appropriate engagement.

- ✅ Removed "Master CTA" from Hero's Journey structure
- ✅ Replaced "Session Extension" with "Content Depth" optimization
- ✅ Updated ending requirements from external CTAs to value reinforcement
- ✅ Enhanced final check to include CTA verification

### 2. Updated Fallback Script Generation Prompt (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)

### 3. CTA Policy Distinction: External vs YouTube Platform

- "Subscribe for more"
- "Hit the notification bell"
- "Like this video if it helped you"
- "Share this video with others"
- "Watch more videos like this"
- "Check out our other videos"
