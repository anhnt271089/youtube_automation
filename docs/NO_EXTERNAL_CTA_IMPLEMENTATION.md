# No External Calls-to-Action Implementation

- ✅ Removed "Master CTA" from Hero's Journey structure
- ✅ Replaced "Session Extension" with "Content Depth" optimization
- ✅ Updated ending requirements from external CTAs to value reinforcement
- ✅ Enhanced final check to include CTA verification

### 2. Updated Fallback Script Generation Prompt (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)

**File:** `/src/services/aiService.js` - fallback prompt in `generateVoiceScript()` method

**Key Updates:**

## Implementation Details

### Updated Prompt Structure

```
⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT ⚠️
This script is for a FACELESS YouTube channel focused on PURE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT.

FACELESS CHANNEL REQUIREMENTS:
❌ NEVER use "I", "me", "my", etc.
✅ ALWAYS use universal language

NO EXTERNAL CALLS-TO-ACTION POLICY:
❌ NEVER include external CTAs
✅ ALWAYS deliver complete value within script itself
✅ ALWAYS make content self-contained
✅ ALWAYS end with value reinforcement, not external actions
```

### Hero's Journey Structure Updated

**Before:**
- Master CTA (2:30-3m): Multi-layered conversion + session extension + community invitation

**After:**
- Content Completion (2:30-3m): Value reinforcement + key takeaway summary + educational closure

### Algorithm Optimization Updated

**Before:**
- Session Extension: "What to watch next" integration + series connectivity

**After:**
- Content Depth: Dense information layers + comprehensive value delivery

**Test Coverage:**
