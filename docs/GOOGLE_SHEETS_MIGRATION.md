| N | Drive Folder | URL | Google Drive folder link |
| O | Detail Workbook URL | URL | Link to detail workbook |
| P | Created Time | Timestamp | Creation timestamp |
| Q | Last Edited Time | Timestamp | Last modified timestamp |

### ✅ Data Validation Setup
Configured proper dropdown validation for all status columns:

**Status Options (Column D):**
- New, Processing, Script Separated, Approved, Generating Images, Completed, Error

**Script Approved Options (Column J):**
- Pending, Approved, Needs Changes

**Voice Generation Status Options (Column L):**
- Not Ready, Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Need Changes

**Video Editing Status Options (Column M):**
- Not Ready, Not Started, In Progress, First Draft, Completed, Published

### ✅ Professional Formatting
- Header row with blue background and white bold text
- Frozen header row for easy navigation
- Auto-resized columns for optimal viewing
- Center-aligned headers

### ✅ Sheet Accessibility
- Configured sharing permissions (anyone with link can edit)
- Public accessibility for team collaboration

## Scripts Created

### 1. Master Sheet Recreation Script
**File:** `/setup/recreate-master-sheet.js`
- Finds existing master sheets
- Creates new sheet with proper structure
- Sets up headers, formatting, and data validation
- Tests integration with existing service
- Updates .env configuration automatically

### 2. Old Sheet Cleanup Script
**File:** `/setup/delete-old-sheet.js`
- Finds old YouTube Automation sheets
- Interactive confirmation before deletion
- Safely moves old sheets to trash
- Prevents accidental deletion of current sheet

## Integration Testing Results

### ✅ All Tests Passed
- Health check: ✅ Healthy
- Video ID generation: ✅ VID-0001 format working
- Video entry creation: ✅ All columns populated correctly
- Status updates: ✅ Dropdown values working
- Script approval: ✅ Workflow progression working
- Auto-population logic: ✅ Voice/Video status tracking working
- Query operations: ✅ Status-based filtering working

## Configuration Updates

### Updated .env File
```bash
GOOGLE_MASTER_SHEET_ID=1ZwFAUc2ijEUxulxgFxXQPx1isMSyH71-HKmhf4SoklI
```

### New Sheet Details
- **Sheet Name:** "YouTube Automation - Video Tracker (2025-08-08)"
- **Sheet ID:** `1ZwFAUc2ijEUxulxgFxXQPx1isMSyH71-HKmhf4SoklI`
- **URL:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwFAUc2ijEUxulxgFxXQPx1isMSyH71-HKmhf4SoklI/edit

## Removed Columns
The following unused columns were removed from the old structure:
- Optimized Title (not used in current workflow)
- Optimized Description (not used in current workflow) 
- Total Sentences (not used in master sheet tracking)
- Completed Sentences (not used in master sheet tracking)
- Thumbnail URLs (not used in current workflow)
- Thumbnail Prompt (not used in current workflow)

These optimizations reduce visual clutter and improve sheet performance while maintaining all actually-used functionality.

## Next Steps

1. **✅ Verify Integration:** New sheet is fully tested and working with `GoogleSheetsService.js`
2. **✅ Configuration Updated:** .env file updated with new sheet ID
3. **✅ Backward Compatibility:** All existing workflow functionality preserved
4. **⏳ Optional:** Delete old master sheet using `/setup/delete-old-sheet.js` when satisfied
5. **⏳ Team Notification:** Inform team members of new sheet URL if needed

## Compatibility Notes

- **Fully backward compatible** with existing `GoogleSheetsService.js`
- **No code changes required** in the main application
- **Preserves all workflow functionality** including auto-population logic
- **Maintains VideoID format** (VID-XXXX) for consistency
