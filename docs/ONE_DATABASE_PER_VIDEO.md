# One Database Per Video - Improved Architecture

## The Problem with Shared Database
- All videos share one Video Details database
- Content gets mixed together
- Hard to filter by specific video
- Difficult to manage individual video progress
- No clean separation of concerns

## New Solution: Dynamic Database Creation

### Architecture:
```
Main Videos Database (1)
├── Video A → Creates "Video A - Script Details" Database
├── Video B → Creates "Video B - Script Details" Database  
├── Video C → Creates "Video C - Script Details" Database
└── ...
```

### Benefits:
1. **🎯 Perfect Separation**: Each video has its own dedicated database
2. **📊 Clean Tabular View**: Pure sentence breakdown per video
3. **🔗 Direct Links**: Main database links directly to video's detail database
4. **📈 Individual Progress**: Track each video's completion independently
5. **🗂️ Easy Management**: Open any video's database to see only its content
6. **🚀 Scalability**: No limit on videos or sentences per video

## Database Structure:

### Main Videos Database
```
- VideoID, Title, YouTube URL, Status
- Channel, Duration, View Count, Published Date
- Optimized Title/Description, Keywords  
- Script Details Database URL (link to video's dedicated database)
- Total Sentences, Completed Sentences
- Script Approved checkbox
```

### Per-Video Script Details Database
**Database Name**: "{Video Title} - Script Details"
```
- Sentence Number (1, 2, 3, ...)
- Script Text (actual sentence content)
- Image Prompt (AI-generated description)
- Generated Image URL (DALL-E generated image)
- Status (Pending → Processing → Image Generated → Complete)
- Word Count (auto-calculated)
- Created Time, Updated Time
```

## Workflow Changes:

### 1. Video Processing:
1. Create main video entry
2. Process YouTube data and AI content
3. **Create dedicated Script Details database** for this video
4. Populate with sentence breakdown
5. Link database URL to main video entry

### 2. Image Generation:
1. Access video's dedicated database
2. Update individual sentence statuses
3. Add image URLs to specific sentences
4. Track completion in main database

### 3. User Experience:
1. **Main Database**: Overview of all videos and their progress
2. **Click Database Link**: Jump directly to video's sentence breakdown
3. **Perfect Tabular View**: Only see sentences for that specific video
4. **Individual Management**: Edit, approve, track each video separately

## Implementation Benefits:

### 🎯 **Clean Architecture**
- No content mixing between videos
- Each database serves single purpose
- Clear ownership and responsibility

### 📊 **Perfect Tabular Format**  
- Each video database is pure table of sentences
- No filtering needed - only shows relevant content
- Exactly what you wanted from Google Sheets but better

### 🔗 **Easy Navigation**
- Main database → Click link → Video's detailed breakdown
- Breadcrumb navigation between levels
- Intuitive user experience

### 🚀 **Unlimited Scalability**
- Process 1000s of videos without performance issues
- Each database stays focused and fast
- No cross-video interference

This approach gives you the **best of both worlds**:
- Clean main overview (like a directory)  
- Dedicated detailed breakdown per video (like individual spreadsheets)
- No Google Drive complications
- Perfect Notion native experience
