# Diagnostic Report: VID-0008 and VID-0013 Issues

**Report Generated:** August 9, 2025  
**Videos Analyzed:** VID-0008, VID-0013

## Executive Summary

Both VID-0008 and VID-0013 experienced workflow failures due to **missing essential assets** (Drive folders and detail workbooks) and were stuck in **"Error"** status. The investigation revealed:

- **Root Cause:** Google Drive API query escaping issues preventing proper asset creation
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Both videos successfully repaired and operational
- **Impact:** Videos are now ready to proceed through normal workflow

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Google Drive API Query Escaping
The core issue was in the `GoogleSheetsService.createVideoDetailWorkbook()` method, which failed when searching for existing workbooks with complex filenames containing:
- Parentheses `()` 
- Apostrophes `'`
- Special characters
- Long titles

**Error Pattern:**
```
Invalid Value error when querying:
name='(VID-0008) How to Control your Brain ( before it's TOO late ) - Video Detail' 
and parents in '...' and trashed=false
```

### Contributing Factors

1. **Insufficient Query Escaping:** The `escapeDriveQuery()` method only escaped single quotes and backslashes, but didn't handle parentheses and other special characters properly.

2. **Migration Legacy Issues:** After migrating from Notion to Google Sheets + Drive, some videos may have been left in incomplete states during the transition.

3. **Complex Filename Patterns:** Using full video titles in folder and workbook names created queries that exceeded Google Drive's query complexity limits.

## Common Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Special Character Issues
- Videos with parentheses, apostrophes, or complex punctuation in titles
- Affects file creation and search operations
- Google Drive queries fail with "Invalid Value" error

### Pattern 2: Workflow State Inconsistency
- Videos stuck in "Error" status despite having valid YouTube metadata
- Missing asset URLs in master sheet prevent workflow progression
- Status not automatically recovered after asset creation

### Pattern 3: Asset Creation Failures
- Drive folder creation succeeds but workbook creation fails
- Partial asset creation leaves videos in incomplete state
- Retry mechanisms don't account for query format issues

## Repair Actions Taken

### Immediate Fixes Applied
1. **Status Reset:** Changed both videos from "Error" to "Ready for Processing"
2. **Asset Creation:** Created Drive folders and detail workbooks using simplified naming
3. **URL Linkage:** Updated master sheet with correct Drive folder and workbook URLs
4. **Basic Population:** Added essential video metadata to workbooks

### Tools Created
- `diagnostic-specific-videos.js` - Comprehensive video health checker
- `search-orphaned-assets.js` - Find disconnected folders/workbooks  
- `manual-fix-specific-videos.js` - Direct asset creation tool
- `repair-videos.js` - Automated repair workflow (identified the core issue)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **✅ COMPLETED:** Both videos are now fixed and ready for normal workflow
2. **Monitor Progress:** Watch these videos proceed through script generation
3. **Manual Approval:** Review generated scripts when they reach approval stage

### System Improvements

#### Priority 1: Critical Fixes
- [ ] **Fix Query Escaping:** Update `escapeDriveQuery()` to handle all special characters:
  ```javascript
  escapeDriveQuery(str) {
    if (!str) return str;
    // Escape all problematic characters for Google Drive queries
    return str.replace(/[()'"\\]/g, '\\$&').replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
  }
  ```
  
- [ ] **Simplify Naming Patterns:** Use safer filename patterns:
  ```javascript
  // Instead of: "(VID-0008) How to Control your Brain ( before it's TOO late ) - Video Detail"
  // Use: "VID-0008 How to Control your Brain - Video Detail"
  const safeName = `${videoId} ${cleanTitle.substring(0, 50)} - Video Detail`;
  ```

#### Priority 2: Resilience Improvements
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Recovery:** Implement fallback naming strategies when complex queries fail
- [ ] **Partial Asset Recovery:** Detect and reconnect orphaned assets automatically  
- [ ] **Status Validation:** Add periodic workflow consistency checks
- [ ] **Asset Verification:** Verify folder/workbook accessibility before marking as created

#### Priority 3: Monitoring & Prevention
- [ ] **Health Check Dashboard:** Regular scans for videos in "Error" status
- [ ] **Asset Integrity Monitoring:** Detect missing or inaccessible Drive assets
- [ ] **Workflow Progress Tracking:** Alert on videos stalled in any status for >24 hours

### Testing Strategy
1. **Regression Testing:** Test video creation with various title formats:
   - Titles with parentheses, apostrophes, quotes
   - Very long titles (>100 characters)
   - Titles with emojis or special Unicode characters
   
2. **Integration Testing:** Verify end-to-end workflow for repaired videos
3. **Load Testing:** Test batch operations with multiple complex titles

## Current Status

### VID-0008 Status: ✅ READY FOR WORKFLOW
- Master sheet: ✅ Updated with correct URLs and status
- Drive folder: ✅ Created and accessible  
- Detail workbook: ✅ Created with proper structure
- Next step: Script generation through main workflow

### VID-0013 Status: ✅ READY FOR WORKFLOW  
- Master sheet: ✅ Updated with correct URLs and status
- Drive folder: ✅ Created and accessible
- Detail workbook: ✅ Created with proper structure  
- Next step: Script generation through main workflow
